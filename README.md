# Linear Regression Without External Libraries

This project implements a simple linear regression model from scratch without using `sklearn`. The model is used to predict salaries based on input data.

## Features
- No external libraries like `sklearn` are used. (It is only used in the end for comparison)
- Uses basic Python and NumPy for computations.

## Files
- `linear_regression_w_o_library.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all the cells to train and test the model.
3. Modify input data to test different salary predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
